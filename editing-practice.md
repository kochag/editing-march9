# Taming the SUV
The popularity of sport utiltiy vehicles (SUVs) and other light trucks (such as pick-ups and minivans) has
taken a big bite out of efforts to improve air quality and reduce global warming. However, a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) entitled "Greener SUVs" shows that these highway monsters can be tamed. Using off-the-shelf technology, UCS engineers have created a blueprint for an SUV that meets high standards for fuel efficiency and emission control with no loss of the teeth that make SUVs so popular.

Envirnomental regulations that govern fuel economy and tailpipe pollution from passenger vehicles continue to ignore light trucks. The average truck on the road today emits 47% more smog-forming exhaust and 43% more of the heat-trapping gases that cause global warming. The impact of this gap
has been compounded by a dramatic shift in Americaâ€™s passenger vehicle market. Over the past two decades, sales of light trucks have tripled. They once accounted for less than a fifth of new vehicle sales, and they now approach a half. The combination of loopholes plus booming sales of light trucks has created enough global warming gases and smog-forming pollution to equal the output of an additional forty million cars.
